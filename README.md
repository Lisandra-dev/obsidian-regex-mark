# Obsidian Regex Mark

Obsidian Regex Mark is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows you to add custom CSS classes to text based on regular expressions.

## Usage

Add a regular expression and a CSS class to the plugin settings. The plugin will then add the CSS class to any text that matches the regular expression.

And `data-contents` will be added to the span tag

### Example

The following regular expression will add the CSS class `comment` to any text that matches the regular expression.

```
regex: //.*$
class: comment
```

And the following text

```markdown
This is a normal line of text. //This is a comment.
```

will be converted to

```html
<p>This is a normal line of text. <span class="comment">//This is a comment.</span></p>
```

It is also possible to create "custom" markdown tags using the `{{open:regex}}` and `{{close:regex}}` syntax. You need to toggle the option `hide` to enable it.

> [!NOTE]
> The usage of `__` for underline (ie `__text__`) is not supported in reading mode, but works well in Live Preview!

The plugin will mimic the behavior of Obsidian with transforming:
```markdown
__text__
```
to
```html
<span>
	<span class="cm-hide">__</span>
	<span class="cm-underline">text</span>
	<span class="cm-hide">__</span>
</span>
```
The css will after hide the `.cm-hide` class, unless you select it (only in livePreview for the selection).

Selecting the text will show everything, like with other markup.

### Example of cool regex

- Underline : `{{open:__}}(.*){{close:__}}`
- SuperScript : `{{open:\^}}(.)` (Note: It works for "one" character only here, but you can use `^x^` syntax if you want to use for more text: `{{open:\^}}(.*){{close:\^}}`)
- SubScript : `{{open:_}}([a-zA-Z\d]\b))` (As before, it works for only one element)

The css for the above example is:

```css
.superscript {
	vertical-align: super;
	font-size: 90%;
}
.subscript {
	vertical-align: sub;
	font-size: 90%;
}
```

### Next steps

You can then use the CSS class to style the text in your CSS snippet or any other usages.
